## Challenge Description
JustWatch is conducting questionnaires/surveys on multiple social media platforms. Surveys are targeting specific `countries`, `demographic groups` and `taste audiences`.

- `demographic group` - population grouped purely based on demographic attributes. Gender, Age.
- `taste audience`  - population grouped based on tv/movie taste preferences. e.g. Action, Comedy, Horror and etc.

This exercise focuses on `Watch Intent` and `Viewership Conversion` survey types. Those surveys are always asking about one particular title (show, show season or movie) and if a person wants to watch it or watched it already.

- `Watch Intent` collects information on a person's watch intention for a particular title in a SVOD platform or cinema in the near future.
- `Viewership Conversion` collects information on how many people watched the title already.

## Tasks

We would like you to 
1.	explore a given dataset: Execute exploratory data analysiS
2.	define/identify clusters in iT: Choose and execute unsupervised clustering method based on data. Identify clusters, evaluate and explain their characteristics.
3.	come up with ideas on how to build viewership conversion prediction models with it for future titles: What are potential prediction tasks that you can define for a given dataset and what are the problems to deal with?

## In the repository
The repository is organised into 3 different folders:
- [Data](https://github.com/clastanga/Predictive_Analytics_JustWatch_Challenge/tree/main/Data) that contains the starting dataset (Predictive analytics) and the generated ones
- [Notebooks](https://github.com/clastanga/Predictive_Analytics_JustWatch_Challenge/tree/main/Notebooks) that contains the code used to clean and analyse and clustering the data
- [Tableau](https://github.com/clastanga/Predictive_Analytics_JustWatch_Challenge/tree/main/Tableau%20and%20Presentation) where are the two Tableau workbooks and the PDF of the presentations. However I built some interactive dashboards to explain the data. 

## Please check the interactive dashboards on my Tableau Public profile at: [Tableau Public(Task_1)](https://public.tableau.com/profile/claudiastangarone#!/vizhome/PredictiveAnalyticsJustWatch_Part1/PredictiveAnalytics_Part1) and [Tableau Public(Task_2)](https://public.tableau.com/profile/claudiastangarone#!/vizhome/PredictiveAnalytics_JustWatch_Clustering/Clusteringinsights?publish=yes)
